  abstract = {{A traditional distributional assumption regarding the returns on a financial asset specifies that the expected returns are identical for all days of the week. Contrary to this plausible assumption, this paper discovers that the expected returns on common stocks and treasury bills are not constant across days of the week. The most notable evidence is for Monday's returns where the mean is unusually low or even negative. Several explanations of the results are investigated, but none proves satisfactory. Aside from documenting significant day of the week effects, the implications of the results for tests of market efficiency are examined. While market-adjusted returns continue to exhibit day of the week effects, these effects are no longer concentrated on Monday}},

Our experiments demonstrate that for time series with long memory, both methods produced comparable results. However, for series with short memory, neural networks outper formed the Box-Jenkins model. We note that some of the comparable results arise since the neural network and time series model appear to be functionally similar models. We have found that for time series of different complexities there are optimal neural network topologies and parameters that enable them to learn more efficiently. Our initial conclusions are that neural networks are robust and provide good long-term forecasting. They are also parsimonious in their data requirements. Neural networks represent a promising alternative for forecasting, but there are problems deter mining the optimal topology and parameters for efficient learning.}},

VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and then to find a member of that family which is close to the target density. Closeness is measured by Kullback–Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this article is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.}},

  issn = {0957-4174}, 
  doi = {10.1016/j.eswa.2014.08.004}, 
  abstract = {{In this paper a novel approach is proposed to predict intraday directional-movements of a currency-pair in the foreign exchange market based on the text of breaking financial news-headlines. The motivation behind this work is twofold: First, although market-prediction through text-mining is shown to be a promising area of work in the literature, the text-mining approaches utilized in it at this stage are not much beyond basic ones as it is still an emerging field. This work is an effort to put more emphasis on the text-mining methods and tackle some specific aspects thereof that are weak in previous works, namely: the problem of high dimensionality as well as the problem of ignoring sentiment and semantics in dealing with textual language. This research assumes that addressing these aspects of text-mining have an impact on the quality of the achieved results. The proposed system proves this assumption to be right. The second part of the motivation is to research a specific market, namely, the foreign exchange market, which seems not to have been researched in the previous works based on predictive text-mining. Therefore, results of this work also successfully demonstrate a predictive relationship between this specific market-type and the textual data of news. Besides the above two main components of the motivation, there are other specific aspects that make the setup of the proposed system and the conducted experiment unique, for example, the use of news article-headlines only and not news article-bodies, which enables usage of short pieces of text rather than long ones; or the use of general financial breaking news without any further filtration.In order to accomplish the above, this work produces a multi-layer algorithm that tackles each of the mentioned aspects of the text-mining problem at a designated layer. The first layer is termed the Semantic Abstraction Layer and addresses the problem of co-reference in text mining that is contributing to sparsity. Co-reference occurs when two or more words in a text corpus refer to the same concept. This work produces a custom approach by the name of Heuristic-Hypernyms Feature-Selection which creates a way to recognize words with the same parent-word to be regarded as one entity. As a result, prediction accuracy increases significantly at this layer which is attributed to appropriate noise-reduction from the feature-space.The second layer is termed Sentiment Integration Layer, which integrates sentiment analysis capability into the algorithm by proposing a sentiment weight by the name of SumScore that reflects investors’ sentiment. Additionally, this layer reduces the dimensions by eliminating those that are of zero value in terms of sentiment and thereby improves prediction accuracy.The third layer encompasses a dynamic model creation algorithm, termed Synchronous Targeted Feature Reduction (STFR). It is suitable for the challenge at hand whereby the mining of a stream of text is concerned. It updates the models with the most recent information available and, more importantly, it ensures that the dimensions are reduced to the absolute minimum.The algorithm and each of its layers are extensively evaluated using real market data and news content across multiple years and have proven to be solid and superior to any other comparable solution. The proposed techniques implemented in the system, result in significantly high directional-accuracies of up to 83.33\%.On top of a well-rounded multifaceted algorithm, this work contributes a much needed research framework for this context with a test-bed of data that must make future research endeavors more convenient. The produced algorithm is scalable and its modular design allows improvement in each of its layers in future research. This paper provides ample details to reproduce the entire system and the conducted experiments.}},

Our method proceeds in three steps: 1) isolating a list of sentiment terms via predictive screening, 2) assigning sentiment weights to these words via topic modeling, and 3) aggregating terms into an article-level sentiment score via penalized likelihood. We derive theoretical guarantees on the accuracy of estimates from our model with minimal assumptions. In our empirical analysis, we text-mine one of the most actively monitored streams of news articles in the financial system — the Dow Jones Newswires — and show that our supervised sentiment model excels at extracting return-predictive signals in this context.}},

In this paper, we first implement a generic stock price prediction framework, and plug in six different models with different analyzing approaches. To take one step further, we use Harvard psychological dictionary and Loughran–McDonald financial sentiment dictionary to construct a sentiment space. Textual news articles are then quantitatively measured and projected onto the sentiment space. Instance labeling method is rigorously discussed and tested. We evaluate the models’ prediction accuracy and empirically compare their performance at different market classification levels.

Unfortunately, the quality, trustworthiness, and comprehensiveness of online content related to stock market vary drastically, and a large portion consists of the low-quality news, comments, or even rumors. To address this challenge, we imitate the learning process of human beings facing such chaotic online news, driven by three principles: sequential content dependency, diverse influence, and effective and efficient learning. In this paper, to capture the first two principles, we designed a Hybrid Attention Networks(HAN) to predict the stock trend based on the sequence of recent related news. Moreover, we apply the self-paced learning mechanism to imitate the third principle. Extensive experiments on real-world stock market data demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

Based on principles of comparative advantage, scholars commonly presume that positive selection is at work, that is, individuals who are most likely to select into college also benefit most from college. Net of observed economic and noneconomic factors influencing college attendance, we conjecture that individuals who are least likely to obtain a college education benefit the most from college. We call this theory the negative selection hypothesis. To adjudicate between the two hypotheses, we study the effects of completing college on earnings by propensity score strata using an innovative hierarchical linear model with data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. For both cohorts, for both men and women, and for every observed stage of the life course, we find evidence suggesting negative selection. Results from auxiliary analyses lend further support to the negative selection hypothesis.}},

When applied to text-to-speech, it yields state-of-the-art performance, with human listeners rating it as significantly more natural sounding than the best parametric and concatenative systems for both English and Mandarin. A single WaveNet can capture the characteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch between them by conditioning on the speaker identity.

We find that the investor sentiment and leverage effect have significant effects on volatility forecasting. In most cases, the leverage effect contains more in-sample and out-of-sample information than the investor sentiment, however, the investor sentiment seems to have more out-of-sample information when forecasting the long-term (i.e., 1-month) future volatility. Furthermore, taking into consideration both the investor sentiment and leverage effect in the original HAR-type models produces better in-sample fitting power and out-of-sample forecasting performance than the corresponding other three kinds of HAR-type models.

Our goal is to establish network-like computational models that are both invariant/equivariant and provably complete in the sense of their ability to approximate any continuous invariant/equivariant map. Our contribution is three-fold. First, in the general case of compact groups we propose a construction of a complete invariant/equivariant network using an intermediate polynomial layer. We invoke classical theorems of Hilbert and Weyl to justify and simplify this construction; in particular, we describe an explicit complete ansatz for approximation of permutation-invariant maps. Second, we consider groups of translations and prove several versions of the universal approximation theorem for convolutional networks in the limit of continuous signals on euclidean spaces. Finally, we consider 2D signal transformations equivariant with respect to the group SE(2) of rigid euclidean motions. In this case we introduce the "charge--conserving convnet" -- a convnet-like computational model based on the decomposition of the feature space into isotypic representations of SO(2). We prove this model to be a universal approximator for continuous SE(2)--equivariant signal transformations.}},

The HTGA approach is a method of combining the traditional genetic algorithm (TGA), which has a powerful global exploration capability, with the Taguchi method, which can exploit the optimum offspring. The Taguchi method is inserted between crossover and mutation operations of a TGA. Then, the systematic reasoning ability of the Taguchi method is incorporated in the crossover operations to select the better genes to achieve crossover, and consequently enhance the genetic algorithms. Therefore, the HTGA approach can be more robust, statistically sound, and quickly convergent. First, the authors evaluate the performance of the presented HTGA approach by studying some global numerical optimization problems. Then, the presented HTGA approach is effectively applied to solve three examples on forecasting the sunspot numbers, tuning the associative memory, and solving the XOR problem. The numbers of hidden nodes and the links of the feedforward neural network are chosen by increasing them from small numbers until the learning performance is good enough. As a result, a partially connected feedforward neural network can be obtained after tuning. This implies that the cost of implementation of the neural network can be reduced. In these studied problems of tuning both network structure and parameters of a feedforward neural network, there are many parameters and numerous local optima so that these studied problems are challenging enough for evaluating the performances of any proposed GA-based approaches. The computational experiments show that the presented HTGA approach can obtain better results than the existing method reported recently in the literature.}},

In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach capable to address the limitations of traditional forecasting approaches and show accurate predictions. The proposed approach is a deep long-short term memory (DLSTM) architecture, as an extension of the traditional recurrent neural network. Genetic algorithm is applied in order to optimally configure DLSTM’s optimum architecture. For evaluation purpose, two case studies from the petroleum industry domain are carried out using the production data of two actual oilfields. Toward a fair evaluation, the performance of the proposed approach is compared with several standard methods, either statistical or soft computing. Using different measurement criteria, the empirical results show that the proposed DLSTM model outperforms other standard approaches.}},

Despite some of these issues surrounding the estimation of the return to schooling, our evidence, based on estimates from a variety of datasets and specifications, is that there is an unambiguously positive effect on the earnings of an individual from participation in education.

Prospect Theory (Kahneman \& Tversky, 1979) asserts that a psychological reference point is influenced by recent changes in one's current asset. Based on this notion, a person who has experienced losses recently was predicted to make riskier choices than a person who has not, but no systematic risk preference was expected for a person experiencing recent gains. Subjects' individual choices were generally consistent with these notions, although one of the key assumptions of the theory was violated. Assuming that a loss person will have a greater influence over a group decision, a group containing a loss member was anticipated to make riskier decisions than a group that does not. The results of three-person group decisions did not show this pattern; instead, the idiosyncratic risky preference of a loss member was found to be overridden by majority influence from nonloss members. Discussion focused on the implications of the loss member's idiosyncratic choice and of the robustness of social/normative factors relative to task/ individual factors.}},

As a result it is shown empirically that within the here selected occupational groups (e.g. librarians and electricians) there is no decisive earnings benefit regarding academic careers, although a positive correlation of income level and educational achievement can be verified. Our findings justify revisiting the underlying assumption that vocational education and training cannot generate benefits comparable with those generated by higher education. The earnings data suggest that monetary aspects may be less crucial than generally assumed to the reputation and perceived value of vocational education and training. Therefore, social status and prestige seem to be the most significant contributory factors to vocational training's low status in Canada.}},

  issn = {0957-4174}, 
  doi = {10.1016/j.eswa.2014.08.004}, 
  abstract = {{In this paper a novel approach is proposed to predict intraday directional-movements of a currency-pair in the foreign exchange market based on the text of breaking financial news-headlines. The motivation behind this work is twofold: First, although market-prediction through text-mining is shown to be a promising area of work in the literature, the text-mining approaches utilized in it at this stage are not much beyond basic ones as it is still an emerging field. This work is an effort to put more emphasis on the text-mining methods and tackle some specific aspects thereof that are weak in previous works, namely: the problem of high dimensionality as well as the problem of ignoring sentiment and semantics in dealing with textual language. This research assumes that addressing these aspects of text-mining have an impact on the quality of the achieved results. The proposed system proves this assumption to be right. The second part of the motivation is to research a specific market, namely, the foreign exchange market, which seems not to have been researched in the previous works based on predictive text-mining. Therefore, results of this work also successfully demonstrate a predictive relationship between this specific market-type and the textual data of news. Besides the above two main components of the motivation, there are other specific aspects that make the setup of the proposed system and the conducted experiment unique, for example, the use of news article-headlines only and not news article-bodies, which enables usage of short pieces of text rather than long ones; or the use of general financial breaking news without any further filtration.In order to accomplish the above, this work produces a multi-layer algorithm that tackles each of the mentioned aspects of the text-mining problem at a designated layer. The first layer is termed the Semantic Abstraction Layer and addresses the problem of co-reference in text mining that is contributing to sparsity. Co-reference occurs when two or more words in a text corpus refer to the same concept. This work produces a custom approach by the name of Heuristic-Hypernyms Feature-Selection which creates a way to recognize words with the same parent-word to be regarded as one entity. As a result, prediction accuracy increases significantly at this layer which is attributed to appropriate noise-reduction from the feature-space.The second layer is termed Sentiment Integration Layer, which integrates sentiment analysis capability into the algorithm by proposing a sentiment weight by the name of SumScore that reflects investors’ sentiment. Additionally, this layer reduces the dimensions by eliminating those that are of zero value in terms of sentiment and thereby improves prediction accuracy.The third layer encompasses a dynamic model creation algorithm, termed Synchronous Targeted Feature Reduction (STFR). It is suitable for the challenge at hand whereby the mining of a stream of text is concerned. It updates the models with the most recent information available and, more importantly, it ensures that the dimensions are reduced to the absolute minimum.The algorithm and each of its layers are extensively evaluated using real market data and news content across multiple years and have proven to be solid and superior to any other comparable solution. The proposed techniques implemented in the system, result in significantly high directional-accuracies of up to 83.33\%.On top of a well-rounded multifaceted algorithm, this work contributes a much needed research framework for this context with a test-bed of data that must make future research endeavors more convenient. The produced algorithm is scalable and its modular design allows improvement in each of its layers in future research. This paper provides ample details to reproduce the entire system and the conducted experiments.}},

  abstract = {{ With the increasing load requirements and the sophistication of power stations, knowing in advance about the electrical load not only at short-term periods such as hours or couple of days but also over the longer-term periods such as weeks and months is indispensable for a range of benefits such as important technical and economic impacts. Traditional methods such as ARMA, SARIMA, and ARMAX have been used for decades. In recent years, the artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as neural networks and deep learning are emerging in the field of time series analysis. Towards this end, the artificial neural networks (ANN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) are being explored and have shown promises in much better forecasting as compared to traditional methods. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are a special kind of RNN that have the capabilities to learn the long-term dependencies. In this work, we have picked up an electrical load data with exogenous variables including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The data is used to train the LSTM network. For a fair comparison, the data is also used in traditional methods to model the load time series. The trained LSTM network and the developed models are then used to forecast over the horizons of 24 hours, 48 hours, 7 days and 30 days. The forecasts generated by the LSTM are compared with the results of traditional methods using RMSE and MAPE for all the forecast horizons. The results of a number of experiments show that the LSTM based forecast is better than other methods and have the potential to further improve the accuracies of forecasts.}},

Accordingly, in the proposed method, multivariate time series data which include hourly load data, hourly temperature time series and fuzzified version of load time series, was converted into multi-channel images to be fed to a proposed deep learning CNN model with proper architecture. By using images which have been created from the sequenced values of multivariate time series, the proposed CNN model could determine and extract related important parameters, in an implicit and automatic way, without any need for human interaction and expert knowledge, and all by itself. By following this strategy, it was shown how employing the proposed method is easier than some traditional STLF models. Therefore it could be seen as one of the big difference between the proposed method and some state-of-the-art methodologies of STLF. Moreover, using fuzzy logic had great contribution to control over-fitting by expressing one dimension of time series by a fuzzy space, in a spectrum, and a shadow instead of presenting it with exact numbers. Various experiments on test data-sets support the efficiency of the proposed method.}},

  abstract = {{ Reactive power forecasting is essential for managing energy systems of factories and industrial plants. However, the scientific community has devoted scant attention to industrial load forecasting, and even less to reactive power forecasting. Many challenges in developing a short-term reactive power forecasting system for factories have rarely been studied. Industrial loads may depend on many factors, such as scheduled processes and work shifts, which are uncommon or unnecessary in classical load forecasting models. Moreover, the features of reactive power are significantly different from active power, so some commonly used variables in classical load forecasting models may become meaningless for forecasting reactive power. In this paper, we develop several models to forecast industrial reactive power. These models are constructed based on two forecasting techniques (e.g., multiple linear regression and support vector regression) and two variable selection methods (e.g., cross validation and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator). In the numerical applications based on real data collected from an Italian factory at both aggregate and individual load levels, the proposed models outperform four benchmark models in short forecast horizons.}},

  abstract = {{ Wind power plays a leading role in the development of renewable energy. However, the random nature of wind turbine power and its associated uncertainty create challenges in dispatching this power effectively in the power system, which can result in unnecessary curtailment of the wind turbine power. Improving the accuracy of wind turbine power forecasting is an effective measure for resolving such problems. This study uses a deep learning network to forecast the wind turbine power based on a long short-term memory network (LSTM) algorithm and uses the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to analyze the error distribution characteristics of short-term wind turbine power forecasting. The LSTM algorithm is used to forecast the power and uncertainties for three wind turbines within a wind farm. According to numerical weather prediction (NWP) data and historical power data for three turbines, the forecasting accuracy of the turbine with the largest number of training samples is the best of the three. For one of the turbines, the LSTM, radial basis function (RBF), wavelet, deep belief network (DBN), back propagation neural networks (BPNN), and Elman neural network (ELMAN) have been used to forecast the wind turbine power. This study compares the results and demonstrates that LSTM can greatly improve the forecasting accuracy. Moreover, this study obtains different confidence intervals for the three units according to the GMM, mixture density neural network (MDN), and relevance vector machine (RVM) model results. The LSTM method is shown to have higher accuracy and faster convergence than the other methods. However, the GMM method has better performance and evaluation than other methods and thus has practical application value for wind turbine power dispatching.}},

  doi = {10.1109/icdmw.2016.0078}, 
  abstract = {{Encouraged by recent waves of successful applications of deep learning, some researchers have demonstrated the effectiveness of applying convolutional neural networks (CNN) to time series classification problems. However, CNN and other traditional methods require the input data to be of the same dimension which prevents its direct application on data of various lengths and multi-channel time series with different sampling rates across channels. Long short-term memory (LSTM), another tool in the deep learning arsenal and with its design nature, is more appropriate for problems involving time series such as speech recognition and language translation. In this paper, we propose a novel model incorporating a sequence-to-sequence model that consists two LSTMs, one encoder and one decoder. The encoder LSTM accepts input time series of arbitrary lengths, extracts information from the raw data and based on which the decoder LSTM constructs fixed length sequences that can be regarded as discriminatory features. For better utilization of the raw data, we also introduce the attention mechanism into our model so that the feature generation process can peek at the raw data and focus its attention on the part of the raw data that is most relevant to the feature under construction. We call our model S2SwA, as the short for Sequence-to-Sequence with Attention. We test S2SwA on both uni-channel and multi-channel time series datasets and show that our model is competitive with the state-of-the-art in real world tasks such as human activity recognition.}},

There is very limited work on exploiting the missing patterns for effective imputation and improving prediction performance. In this paper, we develop novel deep learning models, namely GRU-D, as one of the early attempts. GRU-D is based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a state-of-the-art recurrent neural network. It takes two representations of missing patterns, i.e., masking and time interval, and effectively incorporates them into a deep model architecture so that it not only captures the long-term temporal dependencies in time series, but also utilizes the missing patterns to achieve better prediction results. Experiments of time series classification tasks on real-world clinical datasets (MIMIC-III, PhysioNet) and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance and provide useful insights for better understanding and utilization of missing values in time series analysis.}},

  abstract = {{Artificial neural networks (ANN) have been widely used in recent years to model non-linear time series since ANN approach is a responsive method and does not require some assumptions such as normality or linearity. An important problem with using ANN for time series forecasting is to determine the number of neurons in hidden layer. There have been some approaches in the literature to deal with the problem of determining the number of neurons in hidden layer. A new ANN model was suggested which is called multiplicative neuron model (MNM) in the literature. MNM has only one neuron in hidden layer. Therefore, the problem of determining the number of neurons in hidden layer is automatically solved when MNM is employed. Also, MNM can produce accurate forecasts for non-linear time series. ANN models utilized for non-linear time series have generally autoregressive structures since lagged variables of time series are generally inputs of these models. On the other hand, it is a well-known fact that better forecasts for real life time series can be obtained from models whose inputs are lagged variables of error. In this study, a new recurrent multiplicative neuron neural network model is firstly proposed. In the proposed method, lagged variables of error are included in the model. Also, the problem of determining the number of neurons in hidden layer is avoided when the proposed method is used. To train the proposed neural network model, particle swarm optimization algorithm was used. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, it was applied to a real life time series. Then, results produced by the proposed method were compared to those obtained from other methods. It was observed that the proposed method has superior performance to existing methods.}},

Authors apply feed forward artificial neural network of the RBF type into the process of forecasting the financial data. Except for the standard RBF, authors also test their own new versions of this neural network combined with other techniques of the ML. These models represent new and more advanced version of the standard neural network. Authors add the evolutionary approach into the ANN and also combine the standard algorithm for adapting weights of the ANN with an unsupervised clustering algorithm called K-means. Finally, all of these methods are compared and contrasted with standard (statistical) approach on real economic data to show the potential of using artificial neural network in modelling economic variables.}},

  eprint = {1605.00003}, 
  abstract = {{Predicting trends in stock market prices has been an area of interest for researchers for many years due to its complex and dynamic nature. Intrinsic volatility in stock market across the globe makes the task of prediction challenging. Forecasting and diffusion modeling, although effective can't be the panacea to the diverse range of problems encountered in prediction, short-term or otherwise. Market risk, strongly correlated with forecasting errors, needs to be minimized to ensure minimal risk in investment. The authors propose to minimize forecasting error by treating the forecasting problem as a classification problem, a popular suite of algorithms in Machine learning. In this paper, we propose a novel way to minimize the risk of investment in stock market by predicting the returns of a stock using a class of powerful machine learning algorithms known as ensemble learning. Some of the technical indicators such as Relative Strength Index (RSI), stochastic oscillator etc are used as inputs to train our model. The learning model used is an ensemble of multiple decision trees. The algorithm is shown to outperform existing algo- rithms found in the literature. Out of Bag (OOB) error estimates have been found to be encouraging. Key Words: Random Forest Classifier, stock price forecasting, Exponential smoothing, feature extraction, OOB error and convergence.}},

At issue is how error in the estimates of theseprobabilities affects classification error when the estimates are used ina classification rule. These effects are seen to be somewhat counterintuitive in both their strength and nature. In particular the bias andvariance components of the estimation error combine to influenceclassification in a very different way than with squared error on theprobabilities themselves. Certain types of (very high) bias can becanceled by low variance to produce accurate classification. This candramatically mitigate the effect of the bias associated with some simpleestimators like “naive” Bayes, and the bias induced by thecurse-of-dimensionality on nearest-neighbor procedures. This helps explainwhy such simple methods are often competitive with and sometimes superiorto more sophisticated ones for classification, and why“bagging/aggregating” classifiers can often improveaccuracy. These results also suggest simple modifications to theseprocedures that can (sometimes dramatically) further improve theirclassification performance.}},

The existence of two characteristic time scales in the order of weeks and quarters is discovered and the corresponding prices dynamics are extracted using moving-average-based filtering. These results seem to demonstrate that the crude oil market is consistent with the random-walk assumption only at time scales of the order of days to weeks.

Temporal data arise in these real-world applications often involves a mixture of long-term and short-term patterns, for which traditional approaches such as Autoregressive models and Gaussian Process may fail. In this paper, we proposed a novel deep learning framework, namely Long- and Short-term Time-series network (LSTNet), to address this open challenge. LSTNet uses the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to extract short-term local dependency patterns among variables and to discover long-term patterns for time series trends. Furthermore, we leverage traditional autoregressive model to tackle the scale insensitive problem of the neural network model. In our evaluation on real-world data with complex mixtures of repetitive patterns, LSTNet achieved significant performance improvements over that of several state-of-the-art baseline methods. All the data and experiment codes are available online.}},

Within each outcome, prediction error was strongly associated with the family being predicted and weakly associated with the technique used to generate the prediction. Overall, these results suggest practical limits to the predictability of life outcomes in some settings and illustrate the value of mass collaborations in the social sciences.}},

  abstract = {{While machine learning (ML) methods have received a lot of attention in recent years, these methods are primarily for prediction. Empirical researchers conducting policy evaluations are, on the other hand, pre-occupied with causal problems, trying to answer counterfactual questions: what would have happened in the absence of a policy? Because these counterfactuals can never be directly observed (described as the "fundamental problem of causal inference") prediction tools from the ML literature cannot be readily used for causal inference. In the last decade, major innovations have taken place incorporating supervised ML tools into estimators for causal parameters such as the average treatment effect (ATE). This holds the promise of attenuating model misspecification issues, and increasing of transparency in model selection. One particularly mature strand of the literature include approaches that incorporate supervised ML approaches in the estimation of the ATE of a binary treatment, under the \textbackslashtextit\{unconfoundedness\} and positivity assumptions (also known as exchangeability and overlap assumptions). This article reviews popular supervised machine learning algorithms, including the Super Learner. Then, some specific uses of machine learning for treatment effect estimation are introduced and illustrated, namely (1) to create balance among treated and control groups, (2) to estimate so-called nuisance models (e.g. the propensity score, or conditional expectations of the outcome) in semi-parametric estimators that target causal parameters (e.g. targeted maximum likelihood estimation or the double ML estimator), and (3) the use of machine learning for variable selection in situations with a high number of covariates.}},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.}},

However, precise trend prediction is very difficult since the highly volatile and non-stationary nature of the stock market. Exploding information on the Internet together with the advancing development of natural language processing and text mining techniques have enabled investors to unveil market trends and volatility from online content. Unfortunately, the quality, trustworthiness, and comprehensiveness of online content related to stock market vary drastically, and a large portion consists of the low-quality news, comments, or even rumors. To address this challenge, we imitate the learning process of human beings facing such chaotic online news, driven by three principles: sequential content dependency, diverse influence, and effective and efficient learning. In this paper, to capture the first two principles, we designed a Hybrid Attention Networks(HAN) to predict the stock trend based on the sequence of recent related news. Moreover, we apply the self-paced learning mechanism to imitate the third principle. Extensive experiments on real-world stock market data demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. A further simulation illustrates that a straightforward trading strategy based on our proposed framework can significantly increase the annualized return.}},

Without resets, the state may grow indefinitely and eventually cause the network to break down. Our remedy is a novel, adaptive forget gate that enables an LSTM cell to learn to reset itself at appropriate times, thus releasing internal resources. We review illustrative benchmark problems on which standard LSTM outperforms other RNN algorithms. All algorithms (including LSTM) fail to solve continual versions of these problems. LSTM with forget gates, however, easily solves them, and in an elegant way.}},

The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder-Decoder as an additional feature in the existing log-linear model.

  abstract = {{Training state-of-the-art, deep neural networks is computationally expensive. One way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of the neurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the distribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training cases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the summed input to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces the training time in feed-forward neural networks. However, the effect of batch normalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to apply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch normalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used for normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a single training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its own adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before the non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs exactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also straightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the normalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is very effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks. Empirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the training time compared with previously published techniques.}},

LRU models achieve this goal by creating distinct (but coupled) flow of information inside the units: a first flow along time dimension and a second flow along depth dimension. It also offers a symmetry in how information can flow horizontally and vertically. We analyze the effects of decoupling three different components of our LRU model: Reset Gate, Update Gate and Projected State. We evaluate this family on new LRU models on computational convergence rates and statistical efficiency. Our experiments are performed on four publicly-available datasets, comparing with Grid-LSTM and Recurrent Highway networks. Our results show that LRU has better empirical computational convergence rates and statistical efficiency values, along with learning more accurate language models.}},

Empirical results show that short-term, medium-term and long-term behaviors were generally turning into efficient behavior over time. However, in this way, the results also show that the market did not evolve along stable conditions for long times. Multiscale analysis is also implemented based on multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis.

It also shows that the net benefits are strongly influenced by policy related factors, such as study length, tuition subsidies and student support. Overall, the estimates reported in the article indicate that there are strong incentives for the average student to continue studying beyond the compulsory schooling age, and also point to the benefits of such investment in education for society as a whole. However, the net gains fall with age, mainly reflecting a shorter period to take advantage of the benefits that come with education.

  abstract = {{Considerable effort has been exercised in estimating mean returns to education while carefully considering biases arising from unmeasured ability and measurement error. Recent work has investigated whether there are variations from the “mean” return to education across the population with mixed results. We use an instrumental variables estimator for quantile regression on a sample of twins to estimate an entire family of returns to education at different quantiles of the conditional distribution of wages while addressing simultaneity and measurement error biases. We test whether there is individual heterogeneity in returns to education and find that: more able individuals obtain more schooling perhaps due to lower marginal costs and/or higher marginal benefits of schooling and that higher ability individuals (those further to the right in the conditional distribution of wages) have higher returns to schooling consistent with a non-trivial interaction between schooling and unobserved abilities in the generation of earnings. The estimated returns are never lower than 9 percent and can be as high as 13 percent at the top of the conditional distribution of wages but they vary significantly only along the lower to middle quantiles. Our findings may have meaningful implications for the design of educational policies.}},

However, in many applica- tions, the performance of these methods decays as the forecasting horizon extends beyond these few time steps. This paper aims to explore the challenges of long-horizon forecasting using LSTM networks. Here, we illustrate the long-horizon forecasting problem in datasets from neuroscience and energy supply management. We then propose expectation-biasing, an approach motivated by the literature of Dynamic Belief Networks, as a solution to improve long-horizon forecasting using LSTMs. We propose two LSTM ar- chitectures along with two methods for expectation biasing that significantly outperforms standard practice.}},

It then moves on to review the literature that has looked at the returns from human capital investments to employers. Lack of suitable data and methodological difficulties have resulted in a paucity of studies that have carried out sound empirical work on this issue. In the final part of the review, we look at the work that has tried to assess the contribution of human capital to national economic growth at the macroeconomic level. This work has generally involved using either a ‘growth accounting’ theoretical framework or ‘new growth’ theories. Although the empirical macroeconomic evidence that accompanies this work does not generally allow one to distinguish between the two approaches, there is a substantial body of evidence on the contribution of education to economic growth.}},

One of the key challenges is to learn latent features automatically from dynamically changing multivariate input. In visual recognition tasks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successful to learn generalized feature extractors with shared parameters over the spatial domain. However, when high-dimensional multivariate time series is given, designing an appropriate CNN model structure becomes challenging because the kernels may need to be extended through the full dimension of the input volume. To address this issue, we present two structure learning algorithms for deep CNN models. Our algorithms exploit the covariance structure over multiple time series to partition input volume into groups. The first algorithm learns the group CNN structures explicitly by clustering individual input sequences. The second algorithm learns the group CNN structures implicitly from the error backpropagation. In experiments with two real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our group CNNs outperform existing CNN based regression methods.}},

Further, threshold error correction models provide evidence that all three series move to restore the long run relationship in at least one regime for both pairings.

Seasonality and volatility are important features of tourism data, which makes it a particularly favourable context in which to compare the forecasting performance of linear models to that of nonlinear alternative approaches. Pre-processed official statistical data of overnight stays and tourist arrivals from all the different countries of origin to Catalonia from 2001 to 2009 is used in the study. When comparing the forecasting accuracy of the different techniques for different time horizons, autoregressive integrated moving average models outperform self-exciting threshold autoregressions and artificial neural network models, especially for shorter horizons. These results suggest that the there is a trade-off between the degree of pre-processing and the accuracy of the forecasts obtained with neural networks, which are more suitable in the presence of nonlinearity in the data. In spite of the significant differences between countries, which can be explained by different patterns of consumer behaviour, we also find that forecasts of tourist arrivals are more accurate than forecasts of overnight stays.}},

This paper compares the performance of artificial neural networks (ANNs) with exponential smoothing and ARIMA models in forecasting rice exports from Thailand. To ascertain that the models can reproduce acceptable results on unseen future, we evaluated various aggregate measures of forecast error (MAE, MSE, MAPE, and RMSE) during the validation process of the models. The results reveal that while the Holt–Winters and the Box–Jenkins models showed satisfactory goodness of fit, the models did not perform as well in predicting unseen data during validation. On the other hand, the ANNs performed relatively well as they were able to track the dynamic non-linear trend and seasonality, and the interactions between them.}},

  abstract = {{In financial markets, it is both important and challenging to forecast the daily direction of the stock market return. Among the few studies that focus on predicting daily stock market returns, the data mining procedures utilized are either incomplete or inefficient, especially when a large amount of features are involved. This paper presents a complete and efficient data mining process to forecast the daily direction of the S\&P 500 Index ETF (SPY) return based on 60 financial and economic features. Three mature dimensionality reduction techniques, including principal component analysis (PCA), fuzzy robust principal component analysis (FRPCA), and kernel-based principal component analysis (KPCA) are applied to the whole data set to simplify and rearrange the original data structure. Corresponding to different levels of the dimensionality reduction, twelve new data sets are generated from the entire cleaned data using each of the three different dimensionality reduction methods. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are then used with the thirty-six transformed data sets for classification to forecast the daily direction of future market returns. Moreover, the three different dimensionality reduction methods are compared with respect to the natural data set. A group of hypothesis tests are then performed over the classification and simulation results to show that combining the ANNs with the PCA gives slightly higher classification accuracy than the other two combinations, and that the trading strategies guided by the comprehensive classification mining procedures based on PCA and ANNs gain significantly higher risk-adjusted profits than the comparison benchmarks, while also being slightly higher than those strategies guided by the forecasts based on the FRPCA and KPCA models.}},

Failure of various structural econometric models and models based on linear time series techniques to deliver superior forecasts to the simplest of all models, the simple random walk model, have prompted researchers to use various non-linear techniques. A number of non-linear time series models have been proposed in the recent past for obtaining accurate prediction results, in an attempt to ameliorate the performance of simple random walk models. In this paper, we use a hybrid artificial intelligence method, based on neural network and genetic algorithm for modelling daily foreign exchange rates. A detailed comparison of the proposed method with non-linear statistical models is also performed. The results indicate superior performance of the proposed method as compared to the traditional non-linear time series techniques and also fixed-geometry neural network models.

  abstract = {{As financial time series are inherently noisy and non-stationary, it is regarded as one of the most challenging applications of time series forecasting. Due to the advantages of generalization capability in obtaining a unique solution, support vector regression (SVR) has also been successfully applied in financial time series forecasting. In the modeling of financial time series using SVR, one of the key problems is the inherent high noise. Thus, detecting and removing the noise are important but difficult tasks when building an SVR forecasting model. To alleviate the influence of noise, a two-stage modeling approach using independent component analysis (ICA) and support vector regression is proposed in financial time series forecasting. ICA is a novel statistical signal processing technique that was originally proposed to find the latent source signals from observed mixture signals without having any prior knowledge of the mixing mechanism. The proposed approach first uses ICA to the forecasting variables for generating the independent components (ICs). After identifying and removing the ICs containing the noise, the rest of the ICs are then used to reconstruct the forecasting variables which contain less noise and served as the input variables of the SVR forecasting model. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, the Nikkei 225 opening index and TAIEX closing index are used as illustrative examples. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the SVR model with non-filtered forecasting variables and a random walk model.}},

  abstract = {{Background Isolation of cases and contact tracing is used to control outbreaks of infectious diseases, and has been used for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Whether this strategy will achieve control depends on characteristics of both the pathogen and the response. Here we use a mathematical model to assess if isolation and contact tracing are able to control onwards transmission from imported cases of COVID-19. Methods We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the COVID-19 outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in the number of initial cases, the basic reproduction number (R 0), the delay from symptom onset to isolation, the probability that contacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort. Findings Simulated outbreaks starting with five initial cases, an R 0 of 1·5, and 0\% transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability; however, the probability of controlling an outbreak decreased with the number of initial cases, when R 0 was 2·5 or 3·5 and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R 0 of 1·5 were controllable with less than 50\% of contacts successfully traced. To control the majority of outbreaks, for R 0 of 2·5 more than 70\% of contacts had to be traced, and for an R 0 of 3·5 more than 90\% of contacts had to be traced. The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when R 0 was 1·5. For R 0 values of 2·5 or 3·5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1\% of transmission occurred before symptom onset. Interpretation In most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within 3 months. The probability of control decreases with long delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.

In many cases, the size of the bias is smaller than the width of the 95\% posterior interval for the effect of education on income. Thus, a violation of the strict validity assumption does not necessarily lead to results which are strongly different from those of the strict validity case.

I use longitudinal data to estimate a model of non-random selection of workers among cities. I account for unobservable city-specific demand shocks by using two instrumental variables: the (lagged) city demographic structure and the presence of a land-grant college. I find that a percentage point increase in the supply of college graduates raises high school drop-outs’ wages by 1.9\%, high school graduates’ wages by 1.6\%, and college graduates wages by 0.4\%. The effect is larger for less educated groups, as predicted by a conventional demand and supply model.

We extend earlier work by estimating effects for students that entered college in 1976 over a longer time horizon (from 1983 through 2007) and for a more recent cohort (1989). For both cohorts, the effects of college characteristics on earnings are sizeable (and similar in magnitude) in standard regression models. In selectionadjusted models, these effects generally fall to close to zero; however, these effects remain large for certain subgroups, such as for black and Hispanic students.}},

  abstract = {{Individuals differ not only in their background characteristics but also in how they respond to a particular treatment, intervention, or stimulation. In particular, treatment effects may vary systematically by the propensity for treatment. In this paper, we discuss a practical approach to studying heterogeneous treatment effects as a function of the treatment propensity, under the same assumption commonly underlying regression analysis: ignorability. We describe one parametric method and two nonparametric methods for estimating interactions between treatment and the propensity for treatment. For the first method, we begin by estimating propensity scores for the probability of treatment given a set of observed covariates for each unit and construct balanced propensity score strata; we then estimate propensity score stratum-specific average treatment effects and evaluate a trend across them. For the second method, we match control units to treated units based on the propensity score and transform the data into treatment-control comparisons at the most elementary level at which such comparisons can be constructed; we then estimate treatment effects as a function of the propensity score by fitting a nonparametric model as a smoothing device. For the third method, we first estimate nonparametric regressions of the outcome variable as a function of the propensity score separately for treated units and for control units and then take the difference between the two nonparametric regressions. We illustrate the application of these methods with an empirical example of the effects of college attendance on women’s fertility.}},

On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks.

Each model is trained on lagged returns of all stocks in the S\&P 500, after elimination of survivor bias. From 1992 to 2015, daily one-day-ahead trading signals are generated based on the probability forecast of a stock to outperform the general market. The highest k probabilities are converted into long and the lowest k probabilities into short positions, thus censoring the less certain middle part of the ranking. Empirical findings are promising. A simple, equal-weighted ensemble (ENS1) consisting of one deep neural network, one gradient-boosted tree, and one random forest produces out-of-sample returns exceeding 0.45 percent per day for k=10, prior to transaction costs.

The outperformance relative to the general market is very clear from 1992 to 2009, but as of 2010, excess returns seem to have been arbitraged away with LSTM profitability fluctuating around zero after transaction costs. We further unveil sources of profitability, thereby shedding light into the black box of artificial neural networks. Specifically, we find one common pattern among the stocks selected for trading – they exhibit high volatility and a short-term reversal return profile. Leveraging these findings, we are able to formalize a rules-based short-term reversal strategy that yields 0.23 percent prior to transaction costs. Further regression analysis unveils low exposure of the LSTM returns to common sources of systematic risk – also compared to the three benchmark models.}},

  abstract = {{Few assets in financial history have been as notoriously volatile as cryptocurrencies. While the long term outlook for this asset class remains unclear, we are successful in making short term price predictions for several major crypto assets. Using historical data from July 2015 to November 2019, we develop a large number of technical indicators to capture patterns in the cryptocurrency market. We then test various classification methods to forecast short-term future price movements based on these indicators. On both PPV and NPV metrics, our classifiers do well in identifying up and down market moves over the next 1 hour. Beyond evaluating classification accuracy, we also develop a strategy for translating 1-hour-ahead class predictions into trading decisions, along with a backtester that simulates trading in a realistic environment. We find that support vector machines yield the most profitable trading strategies, which outperform the market on average for Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin over the past 22 months, since January 2018.}},

Much of this growth has been fueled by the success of deep learning architectures: models that map from observables to outputs via multiple layers of latent representations. These deep learning algorithms are effective tools for unstructured prediction, and they can be combined in AI systems to solve complex automated reasoning problems. This paper provides a recipe for combining ML algorithms to solve for causal effects in the presence of instrumental variables -- sources of treatment randomization that are conditionally independent from the response. We show that a flexible IV specification resolves into two prediction tasks that can be solved with deep neural nets: a first-stage network for treatment prediction and a second-stage network whose loss function involves integration over the conditional treatment distribution. This Deep IV framework imposes some specific structure on the stochastic gradient descent routine used for training, but it is general enough that we can take advantage of off-the-shelf ML capabilities and avoid extensive algorithm customization. We outline how to obtain out-of-sample causal validation in order to avoid over-fit. We also introduce schemes for both Bayesian and frequentist inference: the former via a novel adaptation of dropout training, and the latter via a data splitting routine.}},

We propose a model that enhances this feature extraction process for the case of sequential data, by feeding patches of the data into a recurrent neural network and using the outputs or hidden states of the recurrent units to compute the extracted features. By doing so, we exploit the fact that a window containing a few frames of the sequential data is a sequence itself and this additional structure might encapsulate valuable information. In addition, we allow for more steps of computation in the feature extraction process, which is potentially beneficial as an affine function followed by a non-linearity can result in too simple features. Using our convolutional recurrent layers we obtain an improvement in performance in two audio classification tasks, compared to traditional convolutional layers. Tensorflow code for the convolutional recurrent layers is publicly available in https://github.com/cruvadom/Convolutional-RNN.}},

In this research, monthly discharges from 1960 to 2007 were used. The statistics related to first 42years were used to train the models and the 5 past years were used to forecast. In ARMA and ARIMA models, the polynomial was derived respectively with four and six parameters to forecast the inflow. In the artificial neural network, the radial and sigmoid activity functions were used with several different neurons in the hidden layers. By comparing root mean square error (RMSE) and mean bias error (MBE), dynamic artificial neural network model with sigmoid activity function and 17 neurons in the hidden layer was chosen as the best model for forecasting inflow of the Dez dam reservoir. Inflow of the dam reservoir in the 12 past months shows that ARIMA model had a less error compared with the ARMA model. Static and Dynamic autoregressive artificial neural networks with activity sigmoid function can forecast the inflow to the dam reservoirs from the past 60months.}},

One reason for this is that rankings of predictive accuracy across alternative models, which under misspecification are loss function dependent, are universally utilized to assess the usefulness of econometric models. A second reason, which corresponds to the objective of this paper, is that researchers are currently focusing considerable attention on so‐called big data and on new (and old) tools that are available for the analysis of this data. One of the objectives in this field is the assessment of whether big data leads to improvement in forecast accuracy. In this survey paper, we discuss some of the latest (and most interesting) methods currently available for analyzing and utilizing big data when the objective is improved prediction. Our discussion includes a summary of various so‐called dimension reduction, shrinkage and machine learning methods as well as a summary of recent tools that are useful for ranking prediction models associated with the implementation of these methods. We also provide a brief empirical illustration of big data in action, in which we show that big data are indeed useful when predicting the term structure of interest rates. L’analyse des données massives en économie : ce qu’on a appris jusqu’à maintenant et quelles directions pour la prochaine étape?

Une seconde raison, qui correspond à l’objectif de ce mémoire, est que les chercheurs concentrent une portion considérable de leur attention sur ce qu’on appelle les données massives, et les outils (anciens et nouveaux) disponibles pour analyser ce type de données. Un des objectifs dans ce champ d’études est d’établir si les données massives mènent à l’amélioration dans la précision des prévisions. Dans cette étude‐synthèse, les auteurs examinent quelques‐unes des méthodes les plus récentes et les plus intéressantes qui sont disponibles pour analyser et utiliser ce genre de données quand l’objectif est d’améliorer les prévisions. La discussion inclut une présentation succincte d’approches en termes de réduction de dimensions, de rétrécissement, et méthodes d’apprentissage machine, ainsi qu’un résumé succinct d’outillages récents qui sont utiles pour ordonnancer les modèles de prévision associés à la mise en application de ces méthodes.

This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9\% top-5 validation error (and 4.8\% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.}},

  abstract = {{Factors estimated from large macroeconomic panels are being used in an increasing number of applications. However, little is known about how the size and the composition of the data affect the factor estimates. In this paper, we question whether it is possible to use more series to extract the factors, and yet the resulting factors are less useful for forecasting, and the answer is yes. Such a problem tends to arise when the idiosyncratic errors are cross-correlated. It can also arise if forecasting power is provided by a factor that is dominant in a small dataset but is a dominated factor in a larger dataset. In a real time forecasting exercise, we find that factors extracted from as few as 40 pre-screened series often yield satisfactory or even better results than using all 147 series. Weighting the data by their properties when constructing the factors also lead to improved forecasts. Our simulation analysis is unique in that special attention is paid to cross-correlated idiosyncratic errors, and we also allow the factors to have stronger loadings on some groups of series than others. It thus allows us to better understand the properties of the principal components estimator in empirical applications.}},

In this investigation GDP forecasting based on the agriculture and industry added value in gross domestic product (GDP) was analysed separately. Other inputs are final consumption expenditure of general government, gross fixed capital formation (investments) and fertility rate. The relation between product market competition and corporate investment is contentious. On one hand, the relation can be positive, but on the other hand, the relation can be negative. Several methods have been proposed to monitor market power for the purpose of developing procedures to mitigate or eliminate the effects. The most widely used methods are based on indices such as the Hirschman–Herfindahl Index (HHI). The reliability of the ANN models were accessed based on simulation results and using several statistical indicators.

  abstract = {{Rainfall forecasting is important for many catchment management applications, in particular for flood warning systems. The variability of rainfall in space and time, however, renders quantitative forecasting of rainfall extremely difficult. The depth of rainfall and its distribution in the temporal and spatial dimensions depends on many variables, such as pressure, temperature, and wind speed and direction. Due to the complexity of the atmospheric processes by which rainfall is generated and the lack of available data on the necessary temporal and spatial scales, it is not feasible generally to forecast rainfall using a physically based process model. Recent developments in artificial intelligence and, in particular, those techniques aimed at pattern recognition, however, provide an alternative approach for developing of a rainfall forecasting model. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), which perform a nonlinear mapping between inputs and outputs, are one such technique. Presented in this paper are the results of a study investigating the application of ANNs to forecast the spatial distribution of rainfall for an urban catchment. Three alternative types of ANNs, namely multilayer feedforward neural networks, partial recurrent neural networks, and time delay neural networks, were identified, developed and, as presented in this paper, found to provide reasonable predictions of the rainfall depth one time-step in advance. The data requirements for and the accuracy obtainable from these three alternative types of ANNs are discussed.}},

  abstract = {{Improving forecasting especially time series forecasting accuracy is an important yet often difficult task facing decision makers in many areas. Both theoretical and empirical findings have indicated that integration of different models can be an effective way of improving upon their predictive performance, especially when the models in combination are quite different. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are flexible computing frameworks and universal approximators that can be applied to a wide range of forecasting problems with a high degree of accuracy. However, using ANNs to model linear problems have yielded mixed results, and hence; it is not wise to apply ANNs blindly to any type of data. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models are one of the most popular linear models in time series forecasting, which have been widely applied in order to construct more accurate hybrid models during the past decade. Although, hybrid techniques, which decompose a time series into its linear and nonlinear components, have recently been shown to be successful for single models, these models have some disadvantages. In this paper, a novel hybridization of artificial neural networks and ARIMA model is proposed in order to overcome mentioned limitation of ANNs and yield more general and more accurate forecasting model than traditional hybrid ARIMA-ANNs models. In our proposed model, the unique advantages of ARIMA models in linear modeling are used in order to identify and magnify the existing linear structure in data, and then a neural network is used in order to determine a model to capture the underlying data generating process and predict, using preprocessed data. Empirical results with three well-known real data sets indicate that the proposed model can be an effective way to improve forecasting accuracy achieved by traditional hybrid models and also either of the components models used separately.}},

  abstract = {{Electricity, an indispensable resource in daily life and industrial production, is hard to store, so accurate short-term load forecasting (STLF) plays a vital role in resource allocation, capital budgeting of power companies, energy deployment and government control. In recent decades, the strong dependency relationships of time series have been considered in many researches, but the discrete information has not proven to be very useful in their experiments. In general, while discrete information is weak, it can provide macro trends compared to the micro trends of continuous information. In this research, we aim to combine macro and micro information by continuous and discrete time series to generate multiple time series (MTS). The MTS comprise four information sequences: short-term, cycle, long short-term and cross-long short-term. These MTS are used to build a STLF system using a recurrent neural network (RNN) model that can learn sequential information between continuous and discrete series. Therefore, the RNN model with MTS information can improve the forecasting performance for short-term load forecasting. The experimental results show that our proposed forecasting system outperforms the state-of-the-art approach.}},

  doi = {10.1016/j.engappai.2009.09.015}, 
  abstract = {{Accurate predictions of time series data have motivated the researchers to develop innovative models for water resources management. Time series data often contain both linear and nonlinear patterns. Therefore, neither ARIMA nor neural networks can be adequate in modeling and predicting time series data. The ARIMA model cannot deal with nonlinear relationships while the neural network model alone is not able to handle both linear and nonlinear patterns equally well. In the present study, a hybrid ARIMA and neural network model is proposed that is capable of exploiting the strengths of traditional time series approaches and artificial neural networks. The proposed approach consists of an ARIMA methodology and feed-forward, backpropagation network structure with an optimized conjugated training algorithm. The hybrid approach for time series prediction is tested using 108-month observations of water quality data, including water temperature, boron and dissolved oxygen, during 1996–2004 at Büyük Menderes river, Turkey. Specifically, the results from the hybrid model provide a robust modeling framework capable of capturing the nonlinear nature of the complex time series and thus producing more accurate predictions. The correlation coefficients between the hybrid model predicted values and observed data for boron, dissolved oxygen and water temperature are 0.902, 0.893, and 0.909, respectively, which are satisfactory in common model applications. Predicted water quality data from the hybrid model are compared with those from the ARIMA methodology and neural network architecture using the accuracy measures. Owing to its ability in recognizing time series patterns and nonlinear characteristics, the hybrid model provides much better accuracy over the ARIMA and neural network models for water quality predictions.}},

  abstract = {{Although deep learning has produced dazzling successes for applications of image, speech, and video processing in the past few years, most trainings are with suboptimal hyper-parameters, requiring unnecessarily long training times. Setting the hyper-parameters remains a black art that requires years of experience to acquire. This report proposes several efficient ways to set the hyper-parameters that significantly reduce training time and improves performance. Specifically, this report shows how to examine the training validation/test loss function for subtle clues of underfitting and overfitting and suggests guidelines for moving toward the optimal balance point. Then it discusses how to increase/decrease the learning rate/momentum to speed up training. Our experiments show that it is crucial to balance every manner of regularization for each dataset and architecture. Weight decay is used as a sample regularizer to show how its optimal value is tightly coupled with the learning rates and momentums. Files to help replicate the results reported here are available.}},

This involved using a walk forward or sliding window approach from 1970 through 1990 which generated out of sample results. The neural network models achieved a 27 percent and 56 percent lower mean squared error than ARIMA model. The absolute mean error and mean absolute percent error were also lower for the neural network models. The neural network models were able to capture a significant number of turning points for both wheat and cattle, while the ARIMA model was only able to do so for wheat. Since this forecasting method is not problem specific and uses only past prices, it can be applied to other forecasting problems such as stocks and other financial prices.}},

Simulation results on a set of compressor failures showed that in modeling the stochastic nature of reliability data, both the ARIMA and the recurrent neural network (RNN) models outperform the feed-forward model; in terms of lower predictive errors and higher percentage of correct reversal detection. However, both models perform better with short term forecasting. The effect of varying the damped feedback weights in the recurrent net is also investigated and it was found that RNN at the optimal weighting factor gives satisfactory performances compared to the ARIMA model.}},

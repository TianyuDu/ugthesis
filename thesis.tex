	\section{Missing Data}
	\paragraph{} Because the focus is forecasting crude oil returns, which captures the difference between two consecutive prices, The missing data problem can be crucial here.

	\par This paper calculates crude oil returns on one particular day $t$ by taking the difference in logged prices at $t$ and the previous trading day:
	\begin{align}
		r_t &:= \ln(p_t) - \ln(p_{t - \Delta})
	\end{align}
	where $t - \Delta$ is the last trading day before day $t$. As mentioned before, the time gap between two observed prices are not even. For instance, if $t$ is a Monday, then $r_t$ computes the crude oil return between the close price on Monday and the close price on Friday (with $\Delta = 3$). The value of $\Delta$ can be even larger with holidays.

	\begin{table}[H]

			Day of the week & Num. Days. & Num. Trading Days & $\Delta$=1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\

	\section{Day of the Week Effect}
	\paragraph{}The work by Gibbons and Hess examined returns on stocks from S\&P 500, Dow Jones 30, and Treasury Bills. They found strong negative mean returns on Monday compared with other weekdays. The seasonality persisted even after market adjustment measures, such as using mean-adjusted returns instead, were taken \cite{Hess1981}. Analysis in this paper suggests a similar daily seasonality presents in crude oil returns as well.
	\hl{Panels in the figrure below} demonstrate the empirical distributions of returns on each day of the week. We can see that Monday and Wednesday have relatively larger variances, which again matches Gibbons and Hess' observations.

	\par The \hl{two tables} below provide summary statistics for prices and returns on each day. It turns out that Monday is the only weekday with a mean return significantly less than zero.

		\caption{Summary statistics of crude oil returns on each day of week. The first day (January 1, 2000) of the oil price dataset was Saturday, and the observation on the following Monday (January 3) was missing. Hence, the return on Tuesday (January 4) could not be computed because it was the first trading day in this dataset, and there are only 1018 Tuesday in the dataset of returns. A value of $-0.000$ indicates a negative value with magnitude less than $0.0005$. $P$-values are calculated in a two-tailed $t$-test with $\mu_0 = 0$. Bold fonts indicate statistically significance at level $\alpha=0.05$.}

	\subsection{Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for Distributional Similarities}
	\par Smirnov developed a non-parametric method of testing the equality between two continuous distributions, with CDFs $F(x)$ and $G(x)$ respectively, \cite{Smirnov1939}. Refer to Hodges' work for a detailed review on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test \cite{Hodges1957}. I am using the two-tailed version of Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to check whether distributions of two different days are similar.
	Given two datasets, take returns on Monday and Tuesday for example, the null hypothesis says those two datasets are drawn from the same distribution, and the alternative says they are from different distributions \footnote{Different alternative hypotheses can be used in Kolmogorov–Smirnov test: i) $H_1: F(x) \geq G(x)$, ii) $H_1: F(x) \leq G(x)$, and iii) $H_1: F(x) \neq G(x)$. This paper is using the third (two-tailed) alternative hypothesis.}.
	Firstly, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test constructs the empirical CDFs $F_{Mon, 927}(x)$ and $F_{Tue, 1018}(x)$ from the dataset. Then, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic measures the maximum discrepancy between two distribution functions, which is
	\begin{align}
		D := \sup_x \abs{F_{Mon, 927}(x) - F_{Tue, 1018}(x)} \in [0, 1]
	\end{align}
	A smaller $D$-statistic implies stronger distributional similarity between two distributions. For instance, when $F_{Mon, 927}(x)$ and $F_{Tue, 1018}(x)$ are exactly the same, the $D$-statistic is zero. In contrast, let $X=0$ and $Y=1$ be two deterministic random variables, in this case, $D_{X, Y} = 1$.\\
	At a significance level of $\alpha$, $H_0$ is rejected if
	\begin{align}
		D > \sqrt{-\frac{1}{2} \ln \frac{\alpha}{2}} \sqrt{\frac{n+m}{nm}}
	\end{align}
	where $m$ and $n$ denote sizes of two datasets.
	\begin{table}[H]
		\small
		\center
		\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|}
			\hline
			$D$-Statistic ($P$-Value)& Monday & Tuesday & Wednesday & Thursday & Friday \\
			\hline 
			Monday    & 0.000 (1.000) & \textbf{0.061 (0.048)} & \textbf{0.065 (0.030)} & \textbf{0.092 (0.001)} & \textbf{0.092 (0.001)} \\
			Tuesday   &               & 0.000 (1.000) & \textbf{0.044 (0.260)} & 0.036 (0.505) & 0.044 (0.264) \\
			Wednesday &               &               & 0.000 (1.000) & 0.053 (0.114) & \textbf{0.073 (0.009)} \\
			Thursday  &               &               &               & 0.000 (1.000) & 0.025 (0.900) \\
			Friday    &               &               &               &               & 0.000 (1.000) \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
		\caption{The Kolmogorov-Smirnov $D$-Statistic for all pairs of distributions. Bold font indicates the null hypothesis is rejected at a significance level of 0.05, which implies discrepancy in distributions.}
	\end{table}
	\hl{The table above} presents the Kolmogorov-Smirnov $D$-Statistic for distributions of every pairs of days. At a significance level of 0.05, we can see that Monday follows a distribution significantly different from distributions other days follow. Because the dataset does not contain weekend data, the return on Monday is always computed using the difference between log prices on Monday and the previous Friday (Thursday if Friday is not a trading day and so on). Therefore, returns associated with Mondays pick the weekend effect. In fact, the distribution of returns on Monday (over weekend) is the only one with negative mean among distributions of all five days.
